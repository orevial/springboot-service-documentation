=== Different types of docs

There are many ways to document an application, and many can be combined together to form a global and complete
documentation. Here are a few examples of the different types of documentations available when you want to get closer
 to living documentation :

==== README

The level 0 of documentation. Usually contains infos about how to build and test the application on a local/dev
environment.

===== Manual app documentation

A complete guide on how to use the application.

===== Release notes

The changes introduced by each release of the application. Can be handwritten or automatically generated based on Git
 commits and tags or Jira Tickets...

===== Javadoc

The javadoc aims to expose your code documentation to anyone using your application's code (e.g. if your application
is used as a dependency). The generation of javadoc should be automatic

==== REST API

When an application contains REST controllers that are publicly exposed, you often want to provide REST API
documentation to your clients so that they know how to use your API (which methods they can call, using which
parameters, in which format, etc.). This documentation is right next to the code and evolves with it.

==== REST API Snippets

Once you have generated basic REST API documentation (using tools such as Swagger), you might want to go further and
give your clients actual examples of requests and responses they can send and expect to receive to/from your API
methods. Rather than adding static examples to your manual documentation, the best is to provide automatic
documentation based on your actual code. Frameworks such as Spring Restdocs are able to do that for us.

=== Processes




When using Solr Monitoring Agent, a JVM parameter is used (e.g. when the service is deployed externally through
Ansible or Docker) :

[source,java]
----
-Dhostname
----

This is the default parameter. However sometimes, when testing on your local environment, you might want to monitor
another Solr instance because you might not test on a local Solr instance. To do that you can use the specific following
parameter :

[source,java]
----
-DmonitoredHostname
----
